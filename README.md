# Question: How can you determine if all courses can be finished given prerequisites (cycle detection in a graph)? C# Summary

The C# program provided is designed to determine if all courses can be completed given a set of prerequisites, essentially detecting cycles in a graph. The program first creates a dictionary to represent the graph, where each course is a key and its prerequisites are stored in a list as the value. It then uses a depth-first search algorithm to traverse the graph, marking each course as visited once it has been checked. If a course is visited more than once, it indicates a cycle in the graph, meaning there is a circular dependency between courses and not all courses can be completed. If no cycles are detected, it means all courses can be completed. The result is then printed to the console.

# Python Differences

The Python version of the solution uses similar logic to the C# version, but there are some differences in the language features and methods used:

1. Data Structures: Both versions use a dictionary to represent the graph, but the Python version uses a defaultdict from the collections module, which automatically assigns a default value (in this case, an empty list) to non-existent keys. This simplifies the process of adding edges to the graph.

2. Looping: Both versions use a for loop to iterate over the courses and prerequisites. However, Python uses the `for x, y in prerequisites` syntax to unpack the prerequisite pairs directly in the loop header, which is more concise than the C# version.

3. Function Definitions: The Python version defines the DFS function (dfs) inside the main function (canFinish). This is an example of a nested function, which is a feature not available in C#. 

4. Input/Output: The Python version takes input from the user and prints the result to the console, while the C# version has these values hardcoded.

5. Array Initialization: Python uses list comprehension to initialize the visited list, which is a more concise way to create lists based on existing lists.

6. Recursion: Both versions use recursion to implement the DFS, but the Python version uses the `not` keyword to invert the boolean result of the recursive call, which is a bit more readable than the C# version.

7. Variable Assignment: Python uses the `=` operator to assign values to the visited list, while C# uses the `=` operator for assignment and the `==` operator for comparison. Python also uses `-1` and `1` to mark the visited nodes, while C# uses `1` and `2`.

# Java Differences

Both the C# and Java versions solve the problem using the same approach - depth-first search to detect cycles in the graph. However, there are some differences in the language features and methods used in each version.

1. User Input: The Java version asks for user input to determine the number of courses and prerequisites, while the C# version has these values hardcoded.

2. Data Structures: The C# version uses a Dictionary to represent the graph, with each course represented as a key and its prerequisites as a list of values. The Java version uses an array of ArrayLists to represent the graph, with each course represented as an index and its prerequisites as elements in the ArrayList at that index.

3. Arrays: The C# version uses an array of integers to keep track of visited courses, with a value of 1 indicating a course is currently being visited and a value of 2 indicating a course has been completely visited. The Java version uses two boolean arrays to keep track of visited courses and the recursion stack, with a value of true indicating a course has been visited or is in the recursion stack.

4. Looping: The C# version uses a foreach loop to iterate over the prerequisites of each course, while the Java version uses an enhanced for loop to do the same.

5. Method Naming: The C# version uses PascalCase for method names (CanFinish, IsCyclic), which is the standard in C#. The Java version uses camelCase for method names (canFinish, isCyclic), which is the standard in Java.

6. Console Output: The C# version uses Console.WriteLine to print the result, while the Java version uses System.out.println.

7. Main Method: The C# version's main method is static void Main(string[] args), while the Java version's main method is public static void main(String[] args). This is a language-specific difference.
